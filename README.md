## App Brainstorming 
1. Duolingo
    -Friend quests that allow you to have an accountability partner while gaining points
    -Consistent branding with characters and storylines for playful banter
    -UI animations that bring these characters to life and little moments of fun when accomplishing a badge
2.Reddit
    -Ability to upvote and downvote certain comments
    -Niche groups that have people with similar passions and curiosities
    -Moderators that are naturally dedicated to these subreddit communities and have ability to keep peace of community
3.Radio Garden
    -Ability to smoothly zoom in on 3D world map and pinpoint radio stations in regions
    -Ability to save favorite radio stations from around the world for quick access
    -Curated feeds made up of different radio stations based on recommended genres from staff
    
Perhaps a music app that let's you store diary entries since music is so closely correlated with memories and emotions for folks. Something simple as it is a begineer app. If I have more time, some nice animations similar to Spotify wrap and the ability to tell it through voice what mood you're in and have it play your specific playlists automatically. Maybe even a mode for personal notes to show up if toggled through playlist set. 


## Notes

-Had trouble figuring out that we needed to create the file using storyboard. Other than that, everything else was straight forward
